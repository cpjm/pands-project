### Initial Background Research

<p>
I had no idea what this dataset was all about. Before diving in headfirst to do the analysis and programming, it was imperative that I got an understanding of what this data means - to garner a real-world understanding of why it exists and where it came from. 
<br />
 From Wikipedia (1.1) and some informative YouTube videos (e.g. Great Learning 1.2) I discovered the following facts. The data originates from 1936 and was created a botanist and statistician Ronald Fisher. 
<br />
The data set is a collection of measurements of the sepal and petal of 3 varieties of the iris flower - Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor. The flowers were picked from the same field (in Quebec Canada) on the same day and by the same person using the same apparatus. 
<br />
According to the American Museum of Natural History (1.3). 
The sepal is the outer green leaf-like part of the flower bud.  
The petal is the inner coloured part of the flower.

1.1 Wikipedia 
<br />
Wikipedia can be a very informative website for learning facts. 
<br />
This was my go-to for my initial reading about Fisher’s Iris Data Set.

1.2 Great Learning on YouTube 
<br />
I discovered that many videos on YouTube just jumped in headfirst into the analysis of the data. No <br />
explanation as to where the dataset originated from, and what it actually means. 
<br />
This following video by “Great Learning” was an exception to that and provided good initial 
<br />
information and an understanding of what the dataset is all about. It includes pictures of the 3 <br />
irises Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor (1:38). There are also pictures explaining what the 
<br />
measurements mean for the sepal and petal (2:15)

I used this information to learn what a sepal and petal are as I didn’t know the difference.
